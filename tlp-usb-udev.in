# Mode 1 (optional):
# - System startup is handled by tlp-functions:set_usb_suspend()
# - Startup completion is signaled by "flag file" $USB_DONE
# - Newly added devices are handled by this udev script
# - Mode 1 is enabled by the private config variable X_TLP_USB_MODE=1

# Mode 2 (default):
# - Everything - including system startup, but not shutdown - is handled by this udev script

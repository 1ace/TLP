.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tlp \fIcommand\fR \fR[\fIparameters\fR] [-- <config> "..."]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Apply power saving settings manually and control battery care features.
.
.SH COMMANDS
.
.TP
.B start
Initialize \fBtlp\fR and apply power saving settings according to the actual
power source. Also use to apply a changed configuration or to leave manual mode.
.
.TP
.B bat
Apply the battery settings profile and enter manual mode. Manual mode means
that changes to the power source will be ignored until the next reboot or
\fBtlp start\fR is issued to resume automatic mode.
.
.TP
.B true
Same as \fBbat\fR.
.
.TP
.B ac
Apply the AC settings profile and enter manual mode. Manual mode means
that changes to the power source will be ignored until the next reboot or
\fBtlp start\fR is issued to resume automatic mode.
.
.TP
.B false
Same as \fBac\fR.
.
.TP
.B usb
Enable autosuspend for all USB devices, except denylisted ones.
.
.TP
.B bayoff
Turn off optical drive in UltraBay/MediaBay.
The drive may be re\-enabled by pulling the eject lever or pushing the media
eject button on newer models.
.
.PP
Note: charge threshold and recalibration commands below work for
specific laptop vendors and models only. Check the actual support status and
the value ranges with \fBtlp-stat -b\fR. For details on charge thresholds
also refer to the link at the bottom.
.TP
.B setcharge [START_CHARGE STOP_CHARGE] [BAT0|BAT1|BATx]
Changes the charge thresholds for the battery temporarily.
If your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start value to 0.
Configured charge thresholds will be restored at the next boot or by using
\fBtlp setcharge\fR again but without the threshold arguments.
.
.TP
.B fullcharge [BAT0|BAT1|BATx]
Charge the battery to full capacity.
This is done by applying vendor presets to the charge thresholds temporarily.
Configured charge thresholds will be restored at the next boot or by using
\fBtlp setcharge\fR without the threshold arguments.
.
.TP
.B chargeonce [BAT0|BAT1] \fR(ThinkPads only)
Charge the battery to the stop charge threshold once.
This is done by temporarily lifting the start charge threshold.
The configured start charge threshold will be restored at the next boot or by
using \fBtlp setcharge\fR without the threshold arguments.
.
.TP
.B discharge [BAT0|BAT1] \fR(ThinkPads only)
Force complete discharge of the battery.
.
.TP
.B recalibrate [BAT0|BAT1] \fR(ThinkPads only)
Battery recalibration: completely discharge the battery and recharge to 100%.
The latter is done by temporarily applying vendor presets to the thresholds.
Configured thresholds will be restored at the next boot or by using
\fBtlp setcharge\fR.
.
.TP
.B diskid
Show disk ids for configuration.
.
.TP
.B \-- PARAM=value "..."
Add parameters to temporarily overwrite the system configuration
(for this program invocation only).
.
.SH NOTES
For laptops with more than one battery the selection works as follows:
.IP
BAT0 \- Main or internal battery
.IP
BAT1 \- Secondary or replaceable battery
.
.SH EXAMPLES
Change thresholds of the main battery to 70 / 90% temporarily:
.IP
tlp setcharge 70 90 BAT0
.PP
Charge the auxiliary battery to full capacity:
.IP
tlp fullcharge BAT1
.PP
Recalibrate the main battery:
.IP
tlp recalibrate BAT0
.

TLP is a collection of scripts enabling laptop-mode and
implementing power save features for laptop hardware.

Possible settings for ac/battery are:
- kernel laptop-mode, dirty buffer params
- disk apm level
- wake on lan (disable)
- sata link power
- wifi power save (Intel 3945/4965/5x00, kernel < 2.6.30 only)
- sound power save (hda_intel, ac97)
- usb autosuspend with blacklist
- phc controls (requires kernel with phc-patches)
- battery charge thresholds (ThinkPads only)
- power off UltraBay optical drive (ThinkPads only)

Additional functions:
- wifi, bluetooth and wwan devices can be selectively disabled on
  system startup and shutdown.
- wwan state is restored after suspend/hibernate
- run commands conditionally depending on power source

All tlp settings are stored in /etc/default/tlp.

For further details take a look at the man pages:
- tlp
- tlp-stat (display tlp status and active settings)
- wifi, bluetooth, wwan (switch wireless devices on/off)
- run-on-ac, run-on-bat

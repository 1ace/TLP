TLP README - 02.05.2013

TLP implements advanced power management for Linux. TLP is a pure command line tool with
automated background tasks. It does not contain a GUI.

Settings depending on the power source ac/bat:
- Kernel laptop mode and dirty buffer params
- Processor frequency scaling including "turbo boost" / "turbo core"
- Power aware process scheduler for multi-core/hyper-threading
- Hard disk advanced power magement level and spin down timeout (per disk)
- SATA aggressive link power management (ALPM)
- PCIe active state power management (PCIe ASPM) - Kernel 2.6.35 and above
- Runtime power management for PCI(e) bus devices - Kernel 2.6.35 and above
- Radeon graphics KMS power management - Kernel 2.6.35 and above, not fglrx
- Wifi power saving mode -  depending on kernel/driver
- Power off optical drive in drive bay (on battery)

Additional functions:
- I/O scheduler (per disk)
- USB autosuspend with blacklist (input devices excluded automatically)
- Audio power saving mode - hda_intel, ac97
- Enable or disable integrated radio devices upon system startup and shutdown
- Restore radio device state on system startup (from previous shutdown).
- Radio device wizard: switch radios upon network connect/disconnect and dock/undock
- Disable Wake On LAN
- Integrated wwan state is restored after suspend/hibernate
- Untervolting of Intel processors - requires kernel with PHC-Patch
- Battery charge thresholds - ThinkPads only
- Recalibrate battery - ThinkPads only

All TLP settings are stored in /etc/default/tlp. The default configuration
provides optimized power saving out of the box.

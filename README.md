# TLP - Linux Advanced Power Management
TLP is a feature-rich utility for Linux, saving laptop battery power without the
need to delve deeper into technical details.

TLPâ€™s default settings are already optimized for battery life, so you may just
install and forget it. Nevertheless TLP is highly customizable to fulfil your
specific requirements.

Settings are organized into two profiles, enabling you to adjust between savings
and performance independently for battery (BAT) and AC operation.

TLP is a pure command line tool with automated background tasks. It does not
contain a GUI.
